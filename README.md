# Email Client

### A Modern Angular Bootcamp project

[View the demo](https://email-client-peach.vercel.app/)

This Email-client project was done as part of [The Modern Angular Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-angular-bootcamp) course. I finished working on this project in February 2024.

The first part of the application focuses solely on the authentication system. This part is the initial stage of our application's development, built in isolation. 

There are several pages allowing users to navigate for signing in and signing up. Users can access a page displaying a sign-up form, where they can input a username, password, and password confirmation. Upon form submission, a new account representing the user is created on the backend server.

Upon returning to the application after logging out, users can sign in using their previously registered username and password.

The second part is the email-client, where users can send and receive real emails. Upon signing into the application, they are presented with a list of received emails. Clicking on an email opens it in the center panel, displaying sender, recipient, subject, and email content. Users can reply to emails by clicking the reply button, which opens a modal window with fields to compose a response.

Additionally, users can compose new emails by clicking on the compose button, which opens a modal window similar to the reply window but with empty fields for recipient, subject, and content, allowing users to construct their own emails.

**Some of the concepts that form part of this project:**
- Authentication System
- User Input Validation
- Error Handling
